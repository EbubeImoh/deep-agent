It provides a framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM agents or chains in a structured and efficient way. LangGraph helps manage the flow of data and the sequence of operations, allowing developers to focus on the high-level logic of their applications rather than the intricacies of agent coordination. It's particularly useful for building chatbots that handle various request types or multi-agent systems that perform complex tasks.\n"
